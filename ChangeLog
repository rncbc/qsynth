0.4.2  2016-09-14  End of Summer'16 release.

- Old "Start minimized to system tray" option returns to setup.

- Dropped the --enable-qt5 from configure as found redundant given 
  that's the build default anyway (suggestion by Guido Scholz, while

- Dropped old "Start minimized to system tray" option from setup.

- CMake script lists update (patch by Orcan Ogetbil, thanks).

- Added application keywords to freedesktop.org's AppData.

- Fixed for some strict tests for Qt4 vs. Qt5 configure builds.

- German (de) translation update (by Guido Scholz, thanks).


0.3.9  2015-03-25  Pre-LAC2015 release frenzy.

- Added application description as freedesktop.org's AppData.

- New user preference option on whether to show the nagging 'program 
  will keep running in the system tray' message, on main window close.

- Application close confirm warning is now raising the main window 
  as visible and active for due top level display, especially 
  applicable when minimized to the system tray.

- A man page has been added.

- Translations install directory change.

- Allow the build system to include an user specified LDFLAGS.

- Czech (cs) translation updated (by Pavel Fric, thanks).


0.3.8  2013-12-31  A fifth of a Jubilee.

- More preparations for Qt5 configure build.

- Serbian (sr) translation added (by Jay Alexander Fleming, thanks).


0.3.7  2013-04-16  Spring cleaning sale.

- Make(ing) -jN parallel builds now available to the masses (an 
  awesome patch by kensington, thanks).

- Fixed Makefile.in handling of installation directories to the 
  configure script eg. --datadir, --localedir.

- Main window is now brought to front and (re)activated when 
  clicking on the system tray icon instead of just hiding it.

- Debugging stacktrace now applies to all working threads.


0.3.6  2011-04-07  Slip release.

- Main window layout fixing with regard to its user preferred size 
  and recall when system-tray icon is not enabled.

- Channels list preset items now activated on double-click.

- Desktop environment session shutdown (eg. logout) is now tapped 
  for graceful application exit, even though the main window is active 
  (visible) and minimizing to system tray is enabled. Both were 
  causing first shutdown/logout attempt to abort. Not anymore, 
  hopefully ;).

- libX11 is now being added explicitly to the build link phase, as 
  seen necessary on some bleeding-edge distros eg. Fedora 13, Debian 
  6.

- General standard dialog buttons layout is now in place.

- CMake build system. It was silently available in 0.3.5, but now
  it is officially unveiled.

- Fixed a couple of dangling pointers.

- Mac OSX: Enabled the MIDI name Id option for CoreMIDI driver 
  ports, added the icon to the app bundle.


0.3.5  2010-04-27  Overdue release.

- Initial widget geometry and visibility persistence logic has been 
  slightly revised as much to avoid crash failures due to wrong main 
  widget hidden state.

- General source tree layout and build configuration change.

- Most modal message dialog boxes (eg. critical errors) are now 
  replaced by system tray icon bubble messages where available.

- Reverb and Chorus parameter ranges have been revised to match and 
  comply with fluidsynth back-end (libfluidsynth).

- Fluidsynth channel info and unset program interfaces are now in 
  use where available (libfluidsynth >= 1.1.1).

- Global configuration state is now explicitly saved/committed to 
  disk when Options dialog changes are accepted and applied.

- Output peak level meters get their long deserved gradient look.

- Automatic crash-dump reports, debugger stack-traces (gdb), back- 
  traces, whatever, are being introduced as a brand new configure 
  option (--enable-stacktrace) and default enabled on debug build 
  targets (--enable-debug).

- Added Czech (cs) translation, contributed by Pavel Fric.

- The channel preset selector (Channels/Edit...) has been seriously 
  crippled for ages, only showing the presets of the last loaded 
  soundfont, now fixed.

- Minimum number of MIDI channels allowed on engine setup has been 
  dropped from the old value 16 to as low as 1 (one), not that it 
  makes a difference, as (lib)fluidsynth internals just rounds it
  to the nearest multiple of 16 anyway.

- Cleanup to knobs source, simplified from redundant stuff.


0.3.4  2009-05-10  New release.

- Command line option parsing has been slightly refactored to allow 
  custom override through extraordinary fluidsynth option settings 
  (eg. -o name=value; fixes bug #2781579).

- Main form layout has been given a little bit more slack space, 
  just to accommodate some longer text label translations (eg. 
  German).

- Converted obsolete QMessageBox forms to standard buttons.

- Saved channel presets are now effectively loaded on engine 
  startup.

- Russian translation added (thanks to Alexandre Prokoudine).

- Grayed/disabled palette color group fix for dark color themes.

- Qt Software logo update.

- Fait-divers: desktop menu file touched to openSUSE conventions.

- Slight optimizations to the output peak meters refresh rate.

- MIDI and audio device names are now user selectable options 
  through respective drop-down lists on each engine setup dialog.

- New knob style: Skulpture.


0.3.3  2008-07-10  Knobs galore.

- Due to some trouble with newer Qt >= 4.4 applications regarding 
  font size configuration, a new global user option is now available 
  to the rescue: Options.../Other/Base font size (default is no-op).

- Knobs: graphic styles are now QStyle derived classes, which are 
  assigned to the knobs using QWidget::setStyle(). Three styles are 
  implemented in this way, supporting also the legacy QDial: * Our 
  former look, tweaked and ported from Sonic Visualiser. * A port of 
  the new look implemented by David Garcia. * Another ported widget 
  style, designed by Giuseppe Cigala.

- Spanish translation added.

- Attempt to load Qt's own translation support and get rid of the 
  ever warning startup message, unless built in debug moderr; also 
  introducing the very first and complete German translation (patching 
  transaction by Guido Scholz, thanks).

- Messages file logging makes its first long overdue appearance, 
  with user configurable settings in Options/Logging.

- Only one application instance is now allowed to be up and running, 
  with immediate but graceful termination upon startup iif an already 
  running instance is detected, which will see its main widget shown 
  up and all engines started automatically (Qt/X11 platform only).


0.3.2  2007-12-19  Minor stealth fixes and season greetings.

- A new option to start the program minimized when the system tray 
  icon is enabled, is now available from Setup/Misc/Start minimized
  to system tray.

- Regression from QSystemTrayIcon (Qt4 >= 4.2) implementation, at 
  least on X11 environments: while the main application widget was 
  minimized to the system-tray, closing any other top-level widget
  was causing the immediate and unexpected application shutdown.

- Minor corrections on the output peak meter scale aesthetics.

- Tool/child windows position and size preservation fixed.

- Orphaned MIDI device name no longer mistaken when switching 
  between MIDI drivers on engine setup.

- A bit more of precision is achieved over the output peak meters.

- Messages line limit was not being checked, now honored.

- Simple as it could ever be, the build executive summary report is 
  now given on configure.

- Get configure to try and detect the correct qmake location and 
  insert it the search order, so let the qt4 tools take precedence 
  when --with-qt option is given and older qt3 ones coexist and are 
  found located ahead in the PATH.

- The infamous "Keep child windows always on top" global option
  is now supposed to behave a little better when disabled, layering
  child windows as naturally as far the window manager dictates.

- Inspired on Andreas Persson patch, while on qjackctl-devel, which 
  made it possible to compile and run with older Qt 4.1, similar 
  arrangements were carried out on qsynth too, without hesitation.

- Main panel spin-boxes gets accelerated when stressed (Qt >= 4.2).


0.3.1  2007-07-16  Shallowed bug-fix release.

- Now using QSystemTrayIcon class facility if available (Qt4 >= 4.2) 
  making the system-tray option available on most platforms, notably 
  on Windows and Mac OS X.

- Combo-box setup history has been corrected on restore, which was 
  discarding the very initial default (factory) contents.

- One programming error has been corrected, which was affecting the 
  editable preset combo-boxes usability.

- Soundfont context menu is now available again even when the setup 
  dialog soundfont list is empty.

- About form link is now browseable externally.

- Updated README-OSX (thanks to Ebrahim Mayat again).


0.3.0  2007-07-03  Qt4 migration was complete.

- Qt4 migration has comenced and is now complete. Care must be taken 
  with this new configuration file and location: this release starts
  a new one from scratch and won't reuse any of the previous existing 
  ones, although cut and paste might help if you know what you'll be 
  doing :)

- Application icon is now installed to ${prefix}/share/pixmaps; 
  application desktop entry file is now included in installation;
  spec file (RPM) is now a bit more openSUSE compliant; initial 
  debianization.

- Default font option names were adjusted to "Sans Serif" and 
  "Monospace", wherever available.

- The "keep child windows always on top" option is not set as 
  default anymore, because window focus behavior gets tricky on
  some desktop environments (eg. Mac OS X, Gnome).

- Autoconf (configure) scripting gets an update.


0.2.6  2007-04-14  Nitpicking season closed :)

- Main panel window now keeps its previous iconic state on system 
  tray, on application restart (thanks to Chris Cannam for hinting 
  this one).

- Minor optimization in peak level meters update rate. Alternate but 
  faster inline lroundf() function implementation is now used.

- Most top-level widgets were missing the normal-widget flag, which 
  were causing some sticky size behavior on some window managers.

- Messages and channels window captions can now be set smaller as 
  tool-widgets, in effect when child windows are kept always on top.

- While on the engine setup dialog, the ALSA sequencer client 
  identifier is now also disabled depending on the MIDI input option 
  setting.

- Experimental soundfont loader which prevents RAM image duplication 
  if more than one engine loads the same soundfont file. Server-mode 
  is now supported on multi-engine configurations by 
  auto-increnmenting the shell socket listening port (both patches 
  handed by Dave Searls, thanks).

- Engine name gets through the respective tab title when created. 
  Fixed engine delete button enabling on the main window.

- Changed deprecated copyright attribute to license, on qsynth.spec 
  (RPM).

- Added configure support for x86_64 libraries (Pedro 
  Lopez-Cabanillas).

- GPL address update.


0.2.5  2006-03-05  Fancy dial knobs and effective bank-offsets.

- New dial-knob behavior now follows mouse pointer angular position, 
  almost similar to old QDial, but this time avoiding that nasty and 
  rather abrupt change on first mouse click.

- By simple use of widget subclassing, the value/position of any 
  dial knob can now be reset to its default or original position at 
  any time, by simply pressing the mouse mid-button. These default 
  value positions are just committed to current dial values when 
  switching engines and/or closing the application.

- Optional specification of alternate fluidsynth installation path 
  has been added to configure command arguments (--with-fluidsynth).

- After some source code tweaks, a win32 build is now possible. 
  (instructions will be provided on demand :)

- Bank offset finally gets its due effect, while on the channels and 
  channel preset selection dialogs. Regretfully, the soundfont bank 
  offset feature has been lurking ever since its inception, but now 
  its live and hopefully effective.

- A new fancy widget has arrived, qsynthKnob, with some 
  modifications to replace the actual *ugly* QDial widgets in the main 
  window. This widget is based on a design by Thorsten Wilms, formerly 
  implemented by Chris Cannam in Rosegarden, and finally adapted and 
  brought to Qsynth by Pedro Lopez-Cabanillas. Thankyou all.


0.2.4  2005-10-02  Bug and some other usability fixes.

- All widget captions changed to include proper application title 
  prefix.

- Attempt to bring those aging autoconf templates to date; sample 
  SPEC file for RPM build is now being included and generated at 
  configure time.

- Missing icons on channel and soundfont setup context menus are now 
  up; bank/program splitter widget added to channel preset dialog.

- An abrupt segfault on engine restart have been finally fixed; this 
  issue has been quite an annoyance which has been around for ages and 
  was a highly probable showstopper just when restarting an engine due 
  to changes on the setup settings. Not anymore, hopefully.

- New tool buttons were added to the main widget, for adding a new 
  engine and removing the current one, while trying to increase the 
  visibility of multiple fluidsynth engine capability (for new users, 
  at least :)

- Set to use QApplication::setMainWidget() instead of registering 
  the traditional lastWindowClosed() signal to quit() /slot, just to 
  let the -geometry command line argument have some optional effect on 
  X11.

- Minor configure and Makefile install fixes, as Debian and Mac OS X 
  specialties. Also, install does the right thing with target file 
  modes (thanks to Matt Flax and Ebrahim Mayat, for pointing these 
  out).

- Fixed output disability when messages limit option is turned off 
  (thanks to Wolfgang Woehl for spotting this one, while on qjackctl).


0.2.3  2005-05-24  System tray icon and menu option.

- New option for system tray icon and menu, which is known to be 
  effective on KDE enabled desktops; support for freedesktop.org's 
  system tray protocol specification has been included so this
  maybe also effective on Gnome2.

- Setup options for alternate MIDI and Audio devices were 
  introduced.

- Output level meters get smoother and slightly layout optimized.

- Set to ignore the SIGPIPE ("Broken pipe") signal, where available, 
  as the default handler is usually fatal when a JACK client is 
  zombified abruptly.

- Messages window limit is now enforced only when the line count 
  exceeds in one third the user configured line count maximum;
  if Qt 3.2.0+ is in use, the QTextView widget is otherwise set
  to the optimized Qt::LogText format.

- Updated Mac OS X build instructions (README-OSX, by Ebrahim 
  Mayat).


0.2.2  2004-10-08  Output level peak meters and other fixes.

- Minor configure fixes.

- Meanwhile, XPM icon(s) were brainlessly converted to PNG format.

- Engine panel settings are now properly saved on stop/restart.

- Icons were added to the engine tab selector context menu.

- Master gain front panel control gets rescaled and now ranges from 
0..200, with midpoint at 100 (unit gain).

- Added Mac OS X build instructions (README-OSX, by Ebrahim Mayat).

- Soundfont bank offset option gets its trial time; please note that 
  fluidsynth 1.0.5 is needed to build on this feature, which is being 
  properly detected and only enabled at configure time.

- Output level peak meters are now featured as an option, which must 
  be explicitly enabled on setup for those to show up; in addition, 
  overall GUI refresh cycle period has been reduced from 200 to 100 
  msec.

- Top level sub-windows are now always raised and set with active 
  focus when shown to visibility.


0.2.1  2004-04-30  Important internal fixes.

- Channels window reset when switching engines isn't destructive 
  anymore; also reverb and chorus activation were not being correctly 
  updated; these were quite annoying bugs, now fixed.

- Corrected MIDI/Audio driver settings that were being obliterated 
  from the setup dialog option lists; this was causing the 
  impossibility to choose an appropriate driver on certain systems 
  where "alsa_seq" or "jack" may not be available by default (e.g. 
  MacOSX, thanks to Ebrahim Mayat).

- The dash (-) is now a legal character for preset names.

- Translation support for the default preset name "(default)".

- Delete preset confirmation warning message.

- Messages window pops up whenever a critical error message is 
  issued.


0.2.0  2004-03-21  Multi-instance comes to town.

- Multiple fluidsynth engines can now be maintained, with different 
  settings, MIDI and Audio drivers, and more interestingly distinct 
  soundfont stacks. The main user interface has been minimally 
  improved to accomodate this new paradigm, but whole application 
  internals have been massively rewritten.


0.1.3  2004-02-29  More work in progress.

- Message window line limit is now a configurable option on setup.

- ALSA sequencer client name may now be internally set; not of great 
  use for now, but it opens the ground for future workings.

- JACK multiple output port mode may now be configured on setup.

- Makefile.cvs makes its late entrance on the build toolset.


0.1.2  2004-02-16  Work in progress.

- Messages and Channels pop-up windows are not hinted as dialogs 
  anymore and thus are not centered relative to parent main window 
  which has become a strict Qt dialog widget behaviour (as of Qt 
  3.3+).

- Soundfont setup dialog changed to open and load multiple files at 
  once.

- New setup option on wether all child windows are kept on top
  of the main window, or otherwise floating with probable taskbar
  entries of their own.

- Setup changes that are only effective next time the program is
  run gets an informational message box shown to the user.


0.1.1  2004-01-22  Yet more minor bugfixes.

- Messages color retouching.

- Popup menus memory leak fixed.


0.1.0  2003-12-29  Channel preset breakout.

- Added channels breakout and program preset view and edit windows, 
  including a simple preset/profile management feature where the 
  complete channel program assignments may be referenced and saved
  by name.

- Drag and dropped soundfont files are now accepted for immediate 
  load.

- Messages window fallback fix.

- Standard output/error stream capture setup option; handler 
  retouched to be line buffer oriented.


0.0.3  2003-12-12  Few tiny changes so far.

- Single shot timer and restart code path had a graceful rewrite.

- Messages window blankness rendering fix.

- Configure time detection of 'round' library function availability.

- Player drag and drop feature has been prepared, but somehow the 
  internal MIDI player function is still broken.


0.0.2  2003-11-26  Minor bugfixes.

- Gain, Reverb and Chorus front-panel settings are now loosely 
  scaled and properly clipped; this is a first attempt to avoid 
  unstable sound feedback behaviour namely on Reverb.

- MIDI input status led stickyness have been fixed.

- Soundfont open dialog now uses uppercase filter too (*.SF2).

- New configure time argument debugging support (--enable-debug).


0.0.1  2003-11-15  Primordial release.
